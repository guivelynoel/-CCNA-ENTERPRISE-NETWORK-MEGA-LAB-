## Serial Interfaces Limitation (CCNA Concept)

Serial interfaces are available only on routers, not on switches.
In this lab, WAN connectivity is implemented using router-to-router
serial DCE/DTE links to simulate ISP connections.

Layer 3 switches (3560/3650) are used strictly for LAN switching and
inter-VLAN routing using Ethernet and fiber interfaces.
