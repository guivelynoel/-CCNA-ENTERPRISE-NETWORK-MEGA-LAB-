# Step 4 — IP Addressing on Interfaces

This step assigns IP addresses to all router interfaces and core uplinks
without using VLANs or SVIs yet.

Purpose:
- Validate Layer 3 connectivity
- Prepare for dynamic routing (OSPF)
- Ensure WAN links are operational

Point-to-point /30 networks are used for WAN efficiency and clarity.
